Support for Elixir as a target for ANTLR 4

I absolutely love, love, *love* Elixir. I learned it about 10 years ago and even built some game ideas using GenServers back then. However, I only started using it daily recently—and it's been a joy. 

I'm currently building a hacking-themed game engine in Elixir that will feature an in-game, sarcastic programming language called **Rift**. Players will use Rift to create their own hacking tools, adding a whole new level of immersion to the game. Initially, I started developing Rift with Python as the target language for ANTLR, as I have a deadline to meet. However, my ultimate goal is to bring ANTLR support to Elixir, build a runtime for it, and then port Rift to Elixir.

After speaking with Federico from Strumenta, I learned that there weren’t any offical active ANTLR projects targeting Elixir. So here we are! I'll be using Federico's [ANTLR-Kotlin project](https://github.com/Strumenta/antlr-kotlin) as a template to bring Elixir support to ANTLR.
